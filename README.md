## Overview

This is my solution to the Frontend Mentor QR Code Component Challenge. The goal was to build a responsive QR code component that matches the given design.

## My process

I started by adding semantic tags like <main> and <article> to organize the HTML. Then, I set up Tailwind CSS and added custom styles based on the Figma style guide. Finally, I used flexbox to center the component both vertically and horizontally on the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

While working on this QR code component, I strengthened my understanding of semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS.
Key takeaways from the project:
    1. Use semantic elements like <main> and <article> for better accessibility and structure.

    2. Center elements both vertically and horizontally with Tailwind’s flex, items-center, and justify-center.

    3. Keeping the footer at the bottom with flex-grow by making the main content grow to fill available space, the footer stays at the bottom of the screen even when there’s not much content.

    4. Load only specific font weights from Google Fonts to reduce file size.

### Continued development\

I want to get faster at using Tailwind CSS and learn better ways to reuse styles without cluttering the HTML. I also want to keep practicing flexbox and grid so I can build more complex layouts more confidently. I also want to work on small performance improvements, like only loading what the page actually needs.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - This was my main reference for setting up styles and using utilities like flexbox, spacing, and shadows.
